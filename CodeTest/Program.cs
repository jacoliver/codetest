    //The first column in the csv file denotes the shape, "C" for Circle, "R" for rectangle
    //The second column represents either the radius of a circle or the length of the rectangle (depending on the value of the first column)
    //The 3rd column will not be filled for a circle, but will represent the height of a rectangle

    //They would also like the aplication to print 5 smallest shapes by perimeter
    
    //Shapes Inc. have requested this code be of production quality and to have confidence that this code
    //won't break after future development. Add anything that you think may be relevant to satisfy this request
