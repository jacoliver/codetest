    //Shapes Inc. has requested your services to build an application that automates calculations that they currently perform manually
    //They have provided you with a csv file (available in this solution)
    //The first column in the csv file denotes the shape, "C" for Circle, "R" for rectangle
    //The second column represents either the radius of a circle or the length of the rectangle (depending on the value of the first column)
    //The 3rd column will not be filled for a circle, but will represent the height of a rectangle

    //Shapes Inc. would like an application that prints information regarding the 5 largest shapes by area
    //They would also like the aplication to print 5 smallest shapes by perimeter

    //**BONUS QUESTION**
    //Shapes Inc. wish to continue the development of the application after you have built the initial program
    //As such they have asked if you could write unit tests where appropriate to ensure quality
